I don't know about y'all, but sometimes I just want to insert a tab character and I don't want Atom
to argue with me about it! :angry:

Sometimes I'll try to insert a tab and get snippets inserting a bunch of stuff I don't want, or
autocomplete will try to autocomplete something I don't want, or soft tabs is enabled and I
literally **can't** insert an actual tab character without temporarily disabling the setting &mdash;
which is super annoying!

Enter :boom: [`force-tab`](https://atom.io/packages/force-tab)! :boom:

By default Atom outdents code when you press `shift-tab`, but I absolutely never use that! I always
use `cmd-[`, with `cmd-]` for indenting. If you're like me, and sometimes you just want to insert a
damn tab character, I've made `shift-tab` map to a new command that forcibly inserts a tab or an
appropriate number of spaces if `editor.softTabs` is enabled.

Settings for the package include an option to totally disable honoring `editor.softTabs`. There's
also another command, `force-tab:insert-actual-tab`, that _never_ honors soft tab settings.
